# MushroomXpert-Softuniada-2021-Entry-

***This is my part of the MushroomXpert project used in the Softuniada 2021 coding competition. It employs the Keras, TensorFlow and NumPy libraries to create a computer vision model, based on the VGG19 ImageNet model. It distinguishes between 113 different mushroom classes and accurately provides information about the mushroom in the picture provided by the user.***
